# Elastic Leaderships

I just recently got to know about this wonderful concept from a [Tech Leadership training](principal.dev) from Eduards Sizovs,
and after thinking about it and reading the [Elastic Leadership Book](https://www.elasticleadership.com/) from Roy Oshevore
I was curious about the concept of elastic leadership, and I thought I'd share my plans with the team.
