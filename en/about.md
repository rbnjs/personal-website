# About

This website started as a joke to amuse my friends in the office and to have a really cool email address. 
 
Later, I decided to use it as a blog to bring my ideas to life. That was too serious so now is a joke and a website.

The design is [intentionally brutalist](https://brutalist-web.design/). 
I wanted to remove as much clutter as possible and let people read it in any browser they want (this works well on [lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/)). 

I started with a [Pelican blog](https://blog.getpelican.com/) and my [own theme](https://gitlab.com/rbnjs/pelican-zen-theme) but I thought it was too boring
so now I'm using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## About me

Not much about me. I like computers.

Currently, I live in Germany and I work as a Tech Lead.

In the future, I'll probably be a monk or plant cabbage (both, in best case scenario).

## Graveyard

I've worked in the following side projects:

* [HelloPaket](https://web.archive.org/web/20180827091340/https://hellopaket.com/)
* [RocketLauncher](https://web.archive.org/web/20200927120604/https://getrocketlauncher.com/)
* [Second Brain](https://web.archive.org/web/20200927120417/https://secondbrainio.com/)
* [UrbanTalkie](https://urbantalkie.com/)

If you want to check more recent projects, you can go to the code section in the navbar.
