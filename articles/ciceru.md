# A new start with [Ciceru](https://ciceru.com/)

After some months working as an independent engineer, I reconnected with my old friend Fabio and we started discussing working together again.

Am I leaving my dreams of having a product studio? Actually, [Ciceru](https://ciceru.com/) **is** a product studio. We're building a small portfolio of products at the same time and have the flexibility to do what we want, with the added bonus of a salary.

So what is my responsibility? I'm the head code janitor (you could call me Head of Automation). It's a hard role, and we're constantly navigating challenges, but so far I'm happy with it.

Keep checking for more updates in the future.

Here's a photo of us:

## A parenthesis on what works in Software

What works in software right now isn't always the most moral or ethical approach, and the highest quality doesn't always win. 

Success often seems to require connections or political influence. 

Small companies and individuals have less impact than ever, but we're trying to prove it's possible to succeed by following our values.
