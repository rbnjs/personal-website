# So what I’ve been up to?

> TLDR: Quit my job, move to Taiwan, working on LinkFed and looking for collaborators.

After quitting my job and leaving Germany for Taiwan a few months ago, it's hard to give an answer when people ask what I’m doing now. The easiest one is that I’m learning Chinese.

A lot of Chinese speakers (華人) ask me, with amused curiosity, why I would take on such a difficult language. And sure, it’s hard. But it’s also really fun. 

More than that, I’ve always been drawn to collective-oriented cultures. Coming from a socialist country, I found it difficult to adapt to Germany’s strong emphasis on individualism. I constantly felt like I had to "market" myself, and that didn't always align with my values or instincts. Sometimes, I still feel like that, but I've changed.
	
Taiwan has given me the chance to reconnect with a more communal mindset. Spiritually, I’ve been practicing Buddhism and listening to Dharma talks in Chinese. It's deeply inspiring to see people engaging with the Dharma with such sincerity and energy. Buddhism helps me explore who I really am and who I’m not. That’s a journey I’m excited to invest in.

## Rethinking the Job Market

On the work front, if I can even call it that, I’ve been focusing on [4d6.studio](https://4d6.studio), a product laboratory where I bring my ideas to life. The first experiment to emerge is [LinkFed](https://linkfed.4d6.studio), a professional social network loosely inspired by LinkedIn.

But what problem am I solving with LinkFed?

Here’s the gist: finding a job that doesn’t suck (excuse my French) is way harder than it should be. Most of us are stuck in a hamster wheel of hustling for roles that feel hollow, rinse and repeat.

Looking at the broader system, it's clear that there’s a power imbalance. Employers hold most of the cards, even though employees are the ones generating value. Am I criticizing capitalism? Maybe. I don’t claim to have all the answers. But I do know that most existing platforms just mirror the system we already have.

With LinkFed, I wanted to imagine something different, something closer to what I wish we have. A collaborative space that encourages people to help each other and rewards that help in meaningful ways.


## What makes LinkFed different?

So in general, LinkFed has the following differences:


- **Providing freedom to the users** so they can fully express themselves. With Markdown and HTML support, they can create profiles that look and feel like personal websites, not just another form to fill out.
- The **Pebs System** Inspired by "The Monk and the Robot" sci-fi series, "pebs" are a symbolic currency similar to karma on Reddit or Hacker News, but with a twist. There’s no coercion or punishment. Low pebs simply indicate that someone needs help. It’s a gentle, empathetic way to encourage giving.
- **Static Site Deployment**, LinkFed allows users to deploy lightweight static websites, making it easy to showcase portfolios, resumes, or projects.
- **Followable Professional Profiles** like a hybrid between GitHub and LinkedIn: followers can stay updated on your work, posts, and links, without the corporate vibe.

##  What am I looking for?

LinkFed is a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) project, and I’m looking for early users, feedback, and collaborators. I’ve always worked on things I could monetize. This time, I’m doing it because I believe it matters.
